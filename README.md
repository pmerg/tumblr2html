# tumblr2html

tumblr2html is an open source app that creates a static HTML copy of a tumblr blog, including uploaded media (like photos).

## Status

It's still ugly, but somehow works.

- Only posts of type text, link and photo are copied.

- Pages are not copied.

- Generated HTML is really ugly :-)
