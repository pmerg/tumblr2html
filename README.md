# tumblr2html

tumblr2html is an open source app that creates a static HTML copy of a tumblr blog, including uploaded media (like photos).

## Status

It works, but it should be considered still alpha.

## TODO
-   handle answer, video and audio posts.
-   Download pages (I can't find how to do this through the API)
-   Pagination and archives
-   Improve the appearance of generated HTML
-   Incremental "backups"
